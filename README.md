This is a project that will educate on how to code your own shell.

Shell scripting terminologies:

Kernel is the most important part of the operating system. It is the primary interface between the hardware and the processes of a computer. The kernel connects these two in order to adjust resources as effectively as possible.

What is a shell? 
It is the interface to the operating system. The shell is the outermost layer of the operating system. Shells incorporate a programming language to control processes and files, as well as to start and control other programs.

Types of shell:
Bourne shell (sh)
Korn Shell (ksh)
Bourne Again shell (bash)
POSIX shell (sh)

Bourne shell (sh) 
is known as the first shell to be introduced, it is represented by “sh”. This shell got popular because of its quite compact nature. It was made the default shell for the SOLARIS operating system and was used as a Solaris administration script. It has very high-speed operations. 

Korn Shell (ksh)
This shell was developed by David Korn in AT & T bells lab, this was introduced as an improved version or superset of the Bourne shell. It is represented by “ksh”. It has all the features and functionalities of Bourne Shell and also provides some new functionalities to the users. Korn shell has in-built support for arithmetic operations.  

Bourne Again shell (bash)
It is also known as Bash Shell, This shell combines features of the Korn shell and C shell. This shell was designed as an extended version of the Bourne shell. Bourne Again Shell can automatically load previously used commands and can be edited with the help of the arrow keys of the keyboard. 

POSIX shell (sh)
is a standard Unix shell that conforms to the POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) standard. It is a more advanced shell compared to the Thompson Shell and provides a wide range of features, including command history, job control, and shell scripting.
